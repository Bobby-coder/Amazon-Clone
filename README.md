## Usage

To run the application locally; clone the repo, install dependencies and run the app.

The app starts in development mode and opens a browser window on http://localhost:3000. The project rebuilds and the browser reloads automatically when source files are changed. Any build or runtime errors are propagated and displayed in the browser.
